                    <p>Work helps you gain a sense of pride and self-satisfaction by reaffirming that you can support yourself. With work, you earn money to cover bills and pay for activities in your leisure time. It's becoming more common to see people with disabilities in a wide range of jobs throughout the community.</p>
